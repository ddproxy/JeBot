JeBot Help
==========

**NOTE:** JeBot was recently re-written. Many of the features listed here are not complete.

JeBot is a bot written by SirCmpwn. You can email him at sir@cmpwn.com. JeBot hangs out in #minecraft.

If you wish to keep up on development of JeBot, his sister bot is IAmABotAMA. IAmABotAMA hangs out in #IAmABotAMA and has the latest features. IAmABotAMA is unstable.

Note that JeBot is open source. We use a white-hat policy with bug reporting. Anyone who finds a bug that will allow use of manager commands or bestow operatorship upon non-managers
and *uses* it in #minecraft will earn a permenant ban from #minecraft. However, it is encouraged that you quietly notify a manager, or SirCmpwn, that this bug exists.

Upcoming features for JeBot are shown in *italic*.

Commands
--------

JeBot's commands are all prefixed by ".", for example: ".ping". IAmABotAMA uses "@".  If you send either of these bots a private message, omit the control character. You may also use C-style comments: the bot sees ".ping // comment" as ".ping".

Manager-Only Commands
----------------------

**Currently disabled**

Managers are distinct from channel operators. Managers are folks who are able to administrate the bot.  Here are the commands that only they may use:

* **.ban \[user]:** Bans \[user] from the channel. *Planned: .ban \[user] \[time] Alias: .kban*
* *.bans \[user]:* Fetches information about each time [user] has been banned while JeBot was present.
* **.deop \[user]:** Sets -o on \[user]. If \[user] is omitted, you will receive -o.

* **.echo \[text]:** The bot will show \[text].
* **.cs \[command]:** The bot will message ChanServ \[command].
* **.invite \[user]:** Sends a channel invite to \[user].
* **.join \[channel]:** The bot will join \[channel]. This is not permanent. Permanent channel additions must be set in config.xml. Ask SirCmpwn.
* **.kick \[user]:** Kicks \[user] from the channel.
* **.mute:** Sets the channel to +m.
* **.mute \[user]:** Sets +q on \[user]. Alias: .quiet
* *.note \[user]:* Fetches notes about the given user.
* *.note \[user] \[message]:* Records a note about the given user.

Be aware - the manager-only commands have less protection from doing stupid things than the global commands. Double check that the commands you provide are not erroneous.

Output Redirection
------------------

**Currently disabled**

You are able to redirect the bot's output however you like.  For example, say you use this command, and are logged in as "User":

    .ping

The default output would be:

    User: pong

However, you can redirect it:

    .ping @OtherUser

Which outputs:

    OtherUser: pong

Bot managers are able to redirect to private message and other channels as well.

    .ping > OtherUser

This redirects the output to OtherUser via query. Anyone is able to redirect to themselves, only managers may redirect to anyone.

    .ping > #otherchannel

This will redirect the output to any channel the bot is in. This will not work unless the bot is already present in that channel. Only managers may use this feature.

Notes
-----

JeBot also has spam protection and caps lock protection. JeBot will issue a kick to any user that submits more than 5 messages per second, or any user who submits a message whose length is greater than 30 and is 80% or more capital letters. *Additionally, JeBot will automatically set a temporary redirect on users who spam part/join messages to ##fix_your_connection. JeBot will also notify users who incorrectly set their cloaks upon joining.*
